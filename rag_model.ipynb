Through partnerships with nonprofits working on music therapy, Luna Torres hopes to contribute meaningfully to creating positive change while inspiring others to get involved in their communities.\",\n          \"Carlos King's commitment to social justice stems from personal experiences with inequality and a deep belief that music can be a catalyst for positive social change, particularly in addressing systemic racism. They recognize the platform that comes with being a musician and feel a moral obligation to use their voice to advocate for marginalized communities and systemic reform. Through collaborations with nonprofits working on systemic racism, Carlos King aims to create meaningful dialogue and inspire concrete action for justice.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
